# Java to-do list
If it wasn't obvious already, this is in no way meant to be used, this is just a personal project used to build my coding skills in java and to learn more in a practical way.
It may be extremely inefficient when you look at this, this is being written on the first commit, so it is terrible, but it works
I aim to improve efficiency, clean up code and add more features

###### If anything doesn't make sense, hopefully the JavaDoc comments will help, each class and method has slightly informative javadoc, if it doesn't help, good luck.
